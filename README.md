# PELAGIOS Heatmap

The PELAGIOS Heatmap is a mashup of the Roman empire map by Johan Ã…hlfeldt and the PELAGIOS dataset. The
number of geo-annotations available through the PELAGIOS network is superimposed on the map as a heatmap.
There is also a search box which works through the PELAGIOS API.

Visit the online version of the mashup at [http://pelagios.github.io/pelagios-heatmap](http://pelagios.github.io/pelagios-heatmap).
