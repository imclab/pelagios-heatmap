# PELAGIOS Heatmap

The PELAGIOS Heatmap is a mashup of the Roman empire map by Johan Ã…hlfeldt and the PELAGIOS dataset. The
number of geo-annotations available through the PELAGIOS network is superimposed on the map as a heatmap.

Simply open the file 'index.html' in your browser. Note: you need to be online! (The Pelagios dataset is
locally stored, but the background tiles are pulled from the Pelagios server.)
